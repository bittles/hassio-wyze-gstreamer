# Personal HASS Addon for my Wyze cams using Gstreamer

Just gstreamer pipelines as s6 services for two Wyze v3 cams with wz_mini_hacks.  Gstreamer pipelines setup to only work with my cam credentials but shouldn't be hard to make those configurable through config options in the future if anyone else wanted to use this.  Not sure yet how to make it configurable for number of cams without restructuring the s6 services.  Edit the "run" files in root/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/<cam-name-and-quality>// folders if you'd like to adapt this to your setup.
